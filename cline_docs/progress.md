# Progress

## What Works

*   Project structure is set up.
*   Core libraries and dependencies are defined (`requirements.txt`).
*   C extensions for ZigZag calculation (`lib/zigzag.c`) and trade enumeration (`lib/enumerate_trades.c`) exist, along with build infrastructure (`setup.py`, `lib/Makefile`).
*   Helper modules for metrics, plotting, optimization, and utilities exist in `lib/`.
*   A Streamlit application (`streamlit_app.py`) exists, likely for displaying results.
*   Memory Bank documentation structure is established.

## What's Left to Build / Next Steps

1.  **Implement Core Strategy Logic (`strategies/zigzag_fib/signals.py` or `zigzag_fib_strategy.py`):**
    *   Load price data (using `yfinance` or local files).
    *   Integrate ZigZag calculation (using the compiled C extension or a Python implementation).
    *   Implement Fibonacci level calculation based on ZigZag pivots.
    *   Define and implement entry/exit signal generation rules.
2.  **Implement Backtesting Workflow:**
    *   Integrate signal generation with the `enumerate_trades` C extension.
    *   Calculate performance metrics using `lib/metrics.py` based on trade results.
3.  **Implement Optimization:**
    *   Set up an Optuna study to optimize strategy parameters.
    *   Define the objective function for optimization.
4.  **Run and Analyze:**
    *   Execute the backtest and optimization.
    *   Analyze results, potentially using `streamlit_app.py` or plotting functions.
    *   Perform sensitivity analysis.
5.  **Refinement:** Iterate on strategy rules and parameters based on analysis.

## Overall Status

*   **Foundation Laid**: Core components and structure are in place.
*   **Strategy Implementation Pending**: The main ZigZag/Fibonacci strategy logic and its integration into the backtesting framework need to be implemented or completed.
*   **Initial Task**: Run the "terminal strategy" (likely `zigzag_fib_strategy.py`) and debug any issues encountered.
